## The Short Story

I fix problems with data that others don't know exist yet. My analytics career started on a brewery floor - knee-deep in quality metrics, packaging defects, and customer complaints- where I learned that every spike in the data meant something broke (or was about to). That detective work hooked me. Now I hunt for patterns in business data the same way: find the anomaly, trace it back, fix the system.

**What makes me different?** I've debugged quality issues and analysed data to solve them. That operations background means I approach analytics differently - I know which metrics actually matter because I've been the person needing answers at critical moments. My technical focus spans data analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence, with a speciality in predictive modeling, clustering, advanced statistical analysis, and visualization. But my real value? I solve business problems first, then choose the analytical approach - whether that's SQL optimization, Python-based forecasting, or interactive Tableau dashboards - that delivers actionable insights.

## Techical Arsenal
